# Bike Sales Dashboard: Analyzing Purchase Trends with Excel (2023) 🚴‍♂️

Hey there! I kicked off my data analytics journey with this cool "Bike Sales Dashboard" project, diving into a dataset that tracks bike purchases and customer details. After cleaning it up and exploring the data, I built an interactive dashboard in Excel to uncover insights about income, commute habits, and age demographics. Let’s roll through what I did!

## What I Did 💻
- **Data Cleanup**: I removed duplicates and converted it into a table to get a clear look at each column, ensuring the data was solid for analysis.
  

- **Pivot Table Magic**: Used pivot tables to create three key visualizations:
  - **Average Income per Purchase**: Plotted *Gender* on the axis, the *average of Income* in values, and *Purchased Bike (Yes/No)* in the legend. This bar chart shows how income varies by gender and purchase behavior.

  - **Customer Commute**: Built a double line graph with *Commute Distance* on the axis, *count of Purchased Bike* in values, and *Purchased Bike (Yes/No)* in the legend. It reveals how commute distance influences bike purchases.

  - **Customer Age Bracket**: Created a bar chart with *Age Brackets* on the axis, *count of Purchased Bike* in values, and *Purchased Bike (Yes/No)* in the legend. This highlights which age groups are buying bikes.

- **Dashboard Creation**: Combined these charts into a dynamic "Bike Sales Dashboard" in Excel. I added slicers for *Marital Status*, *Education*, and *Region*—all fully functional, letting users filter the data and see real-time changes.

## Tools & Skills 🛠️
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, table creation, pivot tables, charts, and slicers.
- **Analytical Skills**: Transformed raw data into actionable insights with a focus on customer behavior.

## Key Insights 🌟
- Income levels differ by gender and purchase decisions, offering a glimpse into buying power.
- Commute distance plays a big role in bike purchases, with clear trends emerging.
- Certain age brackets show higher bike purchase rates, guiding targeted marketing efforts.

This project showcases my ability to clean data, build interactive visualizations, and deliver insights that matter. I’m excited to bring this enthusiasm and skill set to a data analyst role—let’s connect to discuss how I can contribute to your team! 📊

# 1.Bike Sales Dashboard 🚴‍♂️

Hey there! I kicked off my data analytics journey with this cool "Bike Sales Dashboard" project, diving into a dataset that tracks bike purchases and customer details. After cleaning it up and exploring the data, I built an interactive dashboard in Excel to uncover insights about income, commute habits, and age demographics. Let’s roll through what I did!

## What I Did 💻
- **Data Cleanup**: I removed duplicates and converted it into a table to get a clear look at each column, ensuring the data was solid for analysis.
  

- **Pivot Table Magic**: Used pivot tables to create three key visualizations:

  
  - **Average Income per Purchase**: Plotted *Gender* on the axis, the *average of Income* in values, and *Purchased Bike (Yes/No)* in the legend. This bar chart shows how income varies by gender and purchase behavior.

  - **Customer Commute**: Built a double line graph with *Commute Distance* on the axis, *count of Purchased Bike* in values, and *Purchased Bike (Yes/No)* in the legend. It reveals how commute distance influences bike purchases.

  - **Customer Age Bracket**: Created a bar chart with *Age Brackets* on the axis, *count of Purchased Bike* in values, and *Purchased Bike (Yes/No)* in the legend. This highlights which age groups are buying bikes.

- **Dashboard Creation**: Combined these charts into a dynamic "Bike Sales Dashboard" in Excel. I added slicers for *Marital Status*, *Education*, and *Region*—all fully functional, letting users filter the data and see real-time changes.

# 2.Data Job Listings Analysis 🚀

## What I Did 🔥
- **Data Cleaning & Prep**: Started by wrangling the dataset in Excel—removed duplicates to ensure clean, reliable data, and built pivot tables to summarize key metrics.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Used Excel to calculate averages and counts, creating a first-draft dashboard to shape my vision for the final product.
- **Tableau Visualizations**: Brought the data to life with three impactful graphs in Tableau:
  - **"What Data Job Has the Salary?"**: Showcased the *average yearly salary* by job title, revealing that Senior Data Scientists lead the pack at $154,093/year, while Data Analysts average $91,217.
  - **"Which Data-Related Job Has the Highest Postings?"**: Highlighted the *percentage of total job postings* by title—Data Analysts dominate at over 25%, followed by Data Scientists and Data Engineers.
  - **"How Are Jobs Trending Over Time?"**: Tracked *monthly job posting counts* in 2023, uncovering a peak of 3,554 postings in July and a dip to 1,963 in October.

## The Final Dashboard 🎨
I combined these visualizations into a sleek Tableau dashboard titled **"Data Job Insights: Salaries, Trends, and Postings (2023)"**. This dashboard provides a clear, at-a-glance view of salary benchmarks, hiring trends, and in-demand roles—perfect for anyone navigating the data job market.

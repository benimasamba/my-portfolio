# Bike Sales Dashboard: Analyzing Purchase Trends with Excel (2023) 🚴‍♂️

Hey there! I kicked off my data analytics journey with this cool "Bike Sales Dashboard" project, diving into a dataset that tracks bike purchases and customer details. After cleaning it up and exploring the data, I built an interactive dashboard in Excel to uncover insights about income, commute habits, and age demographics. Let’s roll through what I did!

## What I Did 💻
- **Data Cleanup**: I removed duplicates and converted it into a table to get a clear look at each column, ensuring the data was solid for analysis.
  

- **Pivot Table Magic**: Used pivot tables to create three key visualizations:

  
  - **Average Income per Purchase**: Plotted *Gender* on the axis, the *average of Income* in values, and *Purchased Bike (Yes/No)* in the legend. This bar chart shows how income varies by gender and purchase behavior.

  - **Customer Commute**: Built a double line graph with *Commute Distance* on the axis, *count of Purchased Bike* in values, and *Purchased Bike (Yes/No)* in the legend. It reveals how commute distance influences bike purchases.

  - **Customer Age Bracket**: Created a bar chart with *Age Brackets* on the axis, *count of Purchased Bike* in values, and *Purchased Bike (Yes/No)* in the legend. This highlights which age groups are buying bikes.

- **Dashboard Creation**: Combined these charts into a dynamic "Bike Sales Dashboard" in Excel. I added slicers for *Marital Status*, *Education*, and *Region*—all fully functional, letting users filter the data and see real-time changes.
